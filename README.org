#+TITLE: Ray tracing challenge

Implementing a ray tracer in a test first (TDD) approach in rust.

* Workspaces
** ray-tracer
The main ray tracer implementation.
** builder-derive.
Implements the builder pattern to help with some of the initialisation of variables in the ray tracer.
* TODO's
** TODO check the implementation of ~perlin noise~. Something doesn't seem correct, especially when applying to the checkered pattern.
** TODO save as png directly. Currently saves as a ~.ppm~ file which is can be converted with ImageMagick:
#+begin_src shell
convert scene.ppm scene.png
#+end_src
